# TCP Server and Client - Real-Time Communication Project

This project implements a server capable of communicating with multiple clients simultaneously via TCP sockets. In my demo video, you can see two clients exchanging messages with the server in real-time.

## 💡 Concept in Brief

### Server
- The server listens for incoming connections and responds to clients.

### Client
- The client connects to the server, sends messages, and receives replies in real-time.

### Communication
- Communication between the server and clients is done through TCP sockets, ensuring reliable, real-time message exchange.

### Closing the Connection
- When a client sends the message `bye`, the connection is cleanly closed.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **TCP Sockets**: Using sockets to establish reliable network communication between the server and clients.
- **Python (or another language)**: The programming language used to implement the server and client (mention the language if necessary).

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Implement simple yet effective network communication.
- Illustrate how socket theory can be applied in a concrete project.
- Enable real-time interaction between multiple clients and a server.

## 📝 Conclusion
This project allowed me to see how socket theory comes to life and how network communication can be implemented in a simple yet powerful way, even in a small-scale project!
